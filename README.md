# Untitled Match Three Game
**Author: Tyler Royer**

Thanks for taking a look at my game!  It's still in the very early stages of development, but you're 
more than welcome to try it out!  If you have any questions or want to report a bug, just [shoot me 
an email](mailto:tyler.wayne.royer@gmail.com).   
   
## Instructions
The game doesn't require a lot to run and right now, it just throws you into the game.  You will, 
however, need [download and install java](https://www.java.com/) to run it.  Once you have that, just run the 
lastest .jar file and the game should start right up.   
Please note that I have only tested the game at 1920x1080 resolution at 60FPS.  I'm not sure how 
well it will run on other displays, especially those running at a lower frame rate or at a lower 
resolution.  If you have a different display, feel free to [email me](mailto:tyler.wayne.royer@gmail.com) 
and let me know how it works!
