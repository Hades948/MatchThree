# Untitled Match Three Game
**Author: Tyler Royer**

Thanks for taking a look at my game!  It's still in the very early stages of development, but you're 
more than welcome to try it out!  If you have any questions or want to report a bug, just 
[shoot me an email](mailto:tyler.wayne.royer@gmail.com).   
   
## Instructions
The game doesn't require a lot to run and right now it just throws you right into the game.  You will, 
however, need to [download and install java](https://www.java.com/) to run it.  Once you have done that, 
just run the lastest .jar file found in the ./MatchThree/target folder and the game should start right up.
